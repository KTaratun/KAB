	// If using "channels", which is better, each joint would have a channel object

	// a differing number of keyframes, but also requireing each joint to be interpolated
	// instead of the whole animation.

	// Refer to the "Common methods of computer animation" presentation for more information
	// on TransformNode, channels and additional animation topics.
